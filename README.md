#Tic Tac Toe with Minimax
-------------------------
This is an AI that uses the minimax algorithm for tictactoe. Written for my AI class in BCA. It goes down to each terminal node of a game tree and returns it to see if it is a better value than the one before it. This determines the move the computer makes.
